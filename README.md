While Analysis and Compile Chain - tools for analysing simple imperative algorithms

* While

While is a simple C-like imperative language that only has integer variables, and no such things as scopes or functions.
I guess it's a scripting language.

* WACC

This piece of software was developed as an exercise in Prolog.
It will lex, parse, compile, and run while-programs, and can also
perform analysis on them in terms of what safe assumptions can be made about variable assignments.

* Compiling

The only thing needed to compile the software is SWI-prolog.
Compiling is as simple as issuing the command ```make```.
