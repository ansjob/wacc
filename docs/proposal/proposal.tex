\section{Background}

We both took the course on software semantics last semester at Valhallavägen,
where the programming language \verb|while| was considered.
The course book used defines a compilation function to an abstract machine language which then can be executed using a runtime model also defined in the book.
What we would like to do as an exercise in Prolog is to build a lexer, parser, compiler, and runtime for \verb|while|.
We did consider doing some proofs on while-programs, but as that was part of the semantics course, we would like to do something different,
like implementing a non-trivial lexer/parser in Prolog.
If time permits, we may extend the runtime to symbolic execution, and do some proofs, but this would be the lowest priority in this project.
